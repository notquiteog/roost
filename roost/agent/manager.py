"""Sessions that outlive the client watching them.

A session is a unit of work, not a connection. Closing a tab must not kill an
agent four minutes into a build, and reopening one must not start over — so
sessions live here, clients attach and detach, and the event log in each
session is what makes reattaching cheap.

That has a consequence worth being explicit about: a session with nobody
attached can still be *waiting* on somebody. An approval has no timeout by
design, so a suspended session sits there indefinitely. The reaper below
therefore never closes a session that is waiting on a human, only ones that
have gone quiet on their own.
