"""The whole thing, on a real browser, on a screen of its own.

This is the test the rest of the desktop work is for, and it is deliberately
end to end: a real Xvfb display, a real Chromium launched onto it, a real
booking site, and the actual tools an agent would call — no mocks below the
provider. What it proves, in order:

* the agent gets a screen of its own, and **the pointer on the desk does not
  move** while it works. That is the claim the whole stage design exists to
  make, and the only way to check it is to look at the real display's pointer
  before and after;
* a browser launched onto that stage is visible *on it* — the screenshot is
  not black, and the desktop tools can read the page from the picture;
* the tools do the task: search a city and dates, read the results, open a
  room;
* and then it stops. The last button says "Book this room — pay now", and the
  approval policy grades it a purchase — which no mode auto-runs, including
  `unrestricted`. The test asserts that in the mode that is supposed to be
  able to do anything, because that is the mode where a mistake here would
  actually cost someone money.

Skipped where the machine cannot do it — no Xvfb, no Chromium — rather than
failed: this suite has to pass on a laptop with neither.
