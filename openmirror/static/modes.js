/* Which of the six things this is being right now.
 *
 * A body class, and one event. Everything else — which pane is visible, which
 * rail item is current, whether the composer exists — falls out of CSS, so
 * there is no imperative show/hide to get out of step with itself.
 *
 * Modes are told when they are left as well as when they are entered, and
 * that is the part that matters: a voice call left running because someone
 * clicked away from it is a microphone left open, and an autopilot frame
 * stream left running is a screen being captured for nobody.
