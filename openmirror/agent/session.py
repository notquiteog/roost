"""One agent session: a conversation that can act on the machine.

The shape is a loop — ask the model, run what it asks for, give it the
results, ask again — and the interesting parts are all in what happens
between those steps.

**Approval suspends the loop rather than skipping the call.** When a tool
needs a human, the turn stops on a future and waits. It does not proceed
optimistically and it does not time out into a default, because both of those
turn "are you sure?" into a formality.

**A denial is a tool result, not an error.** The model is told, in the result,
that the person said no and why. That lets it try a different approach, which
is what a person who said no usually wants. Ending the turn instead just
makes them say the same thing again in words.

**Interruption cancels in-flight work.** Killing the task cancels the
provider stream and any running subprocess through normal cancellation, and
the session survives to take the next message with its history intact.
Background work is the exception, on purpose: see agent/tasks.py.

**A subagent is a session too — one with nothing of its own but its
conversation.** It has its own messages and its own, narrower, tool list. Its
events go into this session's log, tagged with the call that started it; its
approvals wait in this session's table; it answers to this session's policy.
So a person watching sees one transcript and answers one set of prompts, and
a mode changed halfway through applies to every agent in the session at once.
