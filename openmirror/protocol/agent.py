"""The agent wire protocol.

One rule shapes everything here: the client is never told a tool ran after
the fact. A tool that touches the machine is *proposed*, the client decides,
and only then does it start. That ordering is what makes a remote agent
something you can leave running, and it is why `tool.proposed` and
`tool.started` are two events rather than one.

Events are a discriminated union on `type`, so a client can switch on one
field and pydantic will refuse anything it does not recognise.
