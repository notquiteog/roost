"""Serving the MCP protocol over HTTP.

Two transports live here because clients are split between them. The current
one is a single endpoint you POST to, where the reply comes back in that POST's
response; the older one is a long-lived `GET /sse` stream plus a `POST` endpoint
the stream names, which is still what a good number of shipped clients speak.
Both hand the same `OpenmirrorMCP` object the same messages — see
`openmirror/mcp/server.py`, where everything that decides anything lives.

**The token is not optional on a network interface.** This endpoint can hand out
a person's memory, so on any bind that is not loopback the router refuses to
mount without `OPENMIRROR_MCP_SERVE_TOKEN`. That is stricter than the rest of the
server, which warns and carries on, and the asymmetry is deliberate: an open
agent endpoint is a machine somebody else can use, and an open twin endpoint is
a person somebody else can read.
