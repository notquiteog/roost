"""What a provider is, and the six things one can be asked to do.

Every provider implements only the modalities it has. Nothing here knows
about Anthropic, OpenAI or Ollama; the registry does the choosing, so adding
a provider is one file and one line, and swapping the speech synthesiser
cannot disturb the chat model.

The message format is deliberately closer to Anthropic's than OpenAI's:
content is a list of typed blocks rather than a string, because tool results,
images and reasoning do not fit in a string and every adapter that pretends
otherwise ends up re-parsing its own output. Flattening blocks into an
OpenAI payload is easy; recovering blocks from a flattened one is not.
